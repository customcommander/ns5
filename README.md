# NS5 (Experimental)

NS5 is an attempt at making yet another JavaScript objects validation library but
with an emphasis on simplicity and ease of use.

So far the libraries I've seen are like they have been written by Java developers on
a really bad _AbstractControllerParadigmFactory_ acid trip.

I believe something a bit more chilled out can be achieved and still be fit for
most common use cases.
